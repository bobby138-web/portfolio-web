    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about coding and currently learning HTML, CSS,database design and python. I'm building my portfolio one project at a time!
        this web mrks the very first step in my journey.i created this portfolioas a part of challengeto learn the basics from scratch.
        i had no prior experience just curiosity,persistence and a vision to bring ideas to life in web.
        from learning semantic tags to playing around with colours ,layout and responsive design,every part of this site has been an experience.
        its just the beginning but i keep going.
        thanks for visiting and watching this journey unfold.
